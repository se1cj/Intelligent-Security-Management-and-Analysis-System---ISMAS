Project Components:

Data Security Analysis:

Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze log data and detect abnormal patterns in the network.
Automatically classify and correct threats based on packet analysis, potential attacks, and user activity.

Network Monitoring System:

Monitoring the live network in real time with real-time traffic analysis.
Detecting DDoS and MITM attacks and applying immediate mitigation measures.
Advanced Identity Management and Authentication:

Supporting multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Using biometric verification (fingerprint, facial recognition) and linking it with artificial intelligence to analyze entry and exit patterns.
Interactive User Interface with Enhanced User Experience (UX/UI):

Interactive graphical interfaces that display real-time security analysis using advanced graphs with an enhanced user experience for easy data analysis.
Support for customizable dashboards for each type of user.
Automated Warning and Response System:

A system that sends alerts and warnings immediately upon detecting suspicious activity.

Executes an automated response (such as closing ports or disabling suspicious accounts).

Third-Party Integrations:

Integrates with SIEM systems such as Splunk and ELK for more in-depth analysis.

Ability to integrate with large network monitoring systems to expand security visibility.

Technical project specifications:

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML):

Programming language: Python using libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.

Data analysis and use of Deep Learning models to classify abnormal behaviors.
Train the model on very large data using scalable neural networks.

Network monitoring system:

Monitoring tools: Scapy and Wireshark for packet analysis.
Build a graphical interface with tools such as Grafana and Kibana to analyze data in real time.
Use protocols such as NetFlow and sFlow to obtain live data.
Multi-Factor Authentication:

Use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to integrate with single sign-on systems.
Add a layer of protection using advanced encryption such as RSA and ECC.
Access Control System:

Build an integrated RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system with dynamic security policy settings.
Support for identity management using LDAP or Active Directory.
